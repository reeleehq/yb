  Prepare and publish a video to YouTube with the `yb` package: transcribe,
  derive title/description/keywords, detect chapters, render a thumbnail,
  upload (with captions), and edit already-published videos (metadata,
  subtitles, chapters, thumbnail). Use when the user wants to publish/upload a
  video to YouTube, prepare YouTube metadata/chapters/subtitles, replace or add
  subtitles on an existing video, or update a published video's title/
  description/tags/thumbnail. For first-time OAuth setup, use yb-setup first.

# yb-publish

Turn a finished video into a YouTube publication, or edit one already up.
Requires `yb[youtube]` and a configured OAuth client (see **yb-setup**).

## Defaults: privacy & playlist (config)

Publishing defaults live in `~/.config/yb/config.json` (next to the OAuth token)
— the single source of truth, so you don't pass them on every call:

```json
{
  "privacy_status": "unlisted",
  "playlist": "TW Uploads",
  "create_playlist_if_missing": true,
  "playlist_privacy_status": "private"
}
```

- **Privacy** defaults to `unlisted` (off the public feed, shareable by link).
- **Playlist**: every upload is added to the named playlist (created if missing,
  as a `private` playlist) so you can find your videos. Adding is idempotent.
- The file is optional — with none, you get `unlisted` and no playlist.

Call-site arguments override the file: `privacy_status="public"` makes one video
public; `playlist=None` skips the playlist for one call; `playlist="Other"`
targets a different one. The result dict gains a `playlist` key:
`{"playlist_id", "playlist_title", "added", "created"}` (or `None`).

Add an *already-published* video to a playlist:

```python
from yb.youtube import add_video_to_playlist

add_video_to_playlist("VIDEO_ID", "TW Uploads")  # find-or-create, idempotent
```

## Reuse-and-persist rule

The transcript SRT lives next to the media (`<basename>.srt`) and is **reused if
present** — re-transcribing costs API credits and the file may be hand-edited.
`yb`/`mixing` handle this automatically (`mixing.transcript.srt_for_media`), and
Scribe responses are cached on disk too. Tell the user when an existing SRT is
reused; to regenerate, delete/rename it.

## Publish (one call)

```python
from yb.youtube import prepare_and_publish

result = prepare_and_publish(
    "promo.fr.mp4",
    language="French",  # language to WRITE metadata in
    language_code="fr",  # metadata language (defaultLanguage)
    audio_language_code="fr",  # spoken language (defaultAudioLanguage) — also the caption language
    brand="Inoocq",  # keep verbatim in copy
    privacy_status="unlisted",
)
print(result["url"], result["privacy_status"])
```

This transcribes (persisting the SRT), writes title/description/keywords (LLM),
detects chapters, renders a thumbnail, uploads, attaches the SRT caption track,
and sets the thumbnail. **Always set the audio language** — the caption track is
uploaded under it.

For full control, build `VideoMetadata` + `CaptionTrack` and call
`yb.youtube.publish_video(...)`.

**If a step after the upload fails** (captions, thumbnail or playlist, e.g. a
403 `quotaExceeded`), the call raises `yb.youtube.PartialPublish`. Its `.result`
holds the new `video_id`, the URL and what was already done. **Save
`err.result` at once, and never re-run the upload**, which would publish a
duplicate. Finish later by calling the same function again with
`resume=err.result`: the upload and the steps already done are skipped. For
`prepare_and_publish`, resume through `publish_content` with the content it
prepared, so the content is not prepared a second time.

## Chapters (default on)

Chapters come from the transcript and are embedded in the description so YouTube
renders interactive chapters. The rules (enforced in code, do not hand-roll):

- First chapter **must** start at `0:00`.
- Each chapter **≥ 10 seconds**; **≥ 3 chapters** total or none are shown.
- 4–8 chapters for a 5–15 min piece; scale up but don't over-segment — mark real
  topic shifts, on cue boundaries, titled in 2–7 words (no leading numbers).

Very short clips (e.g. a 60 s ad) get **no** chapters automatically — that's
expected, not a bug. Pass `with_chapters=False` to skip them.

## Edit an already-published video

```python
from yb.youtube import update_video_fields, upsert_caption, set_chapters, set_thumbnail
from mixing.chapters import Chapter

update_video_fields("VIDEO_ID", title="New title", description="...", tags=["a", "b"])
upsert_caption(
    "VIDEO_ID", "subs.fr.srt", language="fr", name="Français"
)  # replaces same-language track
set_chapters(
    "VIDEO_ID", [Chapter(0, "Intro"), Chapter(45, "Demo"), Chapter(120, "Pricing")]
)
set_thumbnail("VIDEO_ID", "thumb.jpg")
```

`upsert_caption` updates an existing uploaded (`standard`) track in the same
language, else inserts one. (YouTube's own auto `asr` tracks are left alone.)

**Change privacy, or replace a published video.** YouTube cannot replace a
video's file, so a re-cut is a new upload. `update_video_status(id,
privacy_status="public")` changes privacy and keeps the other status fields.
`supersede(old_id, new_id)` puts the new upload into every playlist of yours
that held the old one, removes the old one from them, and makes the old one
private. It never deletes anything, and it is safe to re-run.


## Read live stats & metadata

`video_metadata` fetches a flattened, typed view of a video's live numbers
(views, likes, dislikes, comments, ...) plus content/status details in one call:

```python
from yb.youtube import video_metadata, FIELD_GROUPS

video_metadata("VIDEO_ID", group="engagement")  # dict of the live numbers
print(
    video_metadata("VIDEO_ID", group="engagement", as_table=True)
)  # readable ASCII table
video_metadata(
    "VIDEO_ID", fields=["title", "views", "likes"]
)  # pick/order exact fields
print(
    video_metadata(["ID1", "ID2"], group="engagement", as_table=True)
)  # compare videos (row each)
```

- No `group`/`fields` → every available field. `fields` overrides `group`.
- Named groups (`FIELD_GROUPS`): `engagement`, `overview`, `content`, `status`, `identity`.
- `dislikes` is returned **only to the video's owner**; else `None`. Deeper
  metrics (watch time, shares, retention) need the YouTube **Analytics** API +
  the `yt-analytics.readonly` scope — not covered here.

## Notes

- Multilingual: dub/translate with `mixing.dubbing` first, then publish each
  language version as its own video with its own `language_code`/`audio_language_code`.
- The result dict's `privacy_status` reflects what YouTube actually set — an
  unaudited project may force `private` (see yb-setup).
- The API cannot *pin* comments; surface suggested pinned-comment text for the
  user to post manually.
