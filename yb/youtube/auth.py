    ``profile`` selects a named account (``youtube_token.<profile>.json``; see
    :mod:`yb.config`); ``None`` falls back to ``$YB_PROFILE``, then to the
    default account. An explicit ``token_file`` wins over the profile.

    First use runs the installed-app consent flow and caches the token to
    ``token_file`` so later calls are non-interactive. Expired tokens are
    refreshed automatically.

    Pass ``interactive=False`` when nobody can answer a consent prompt — a cron
    job, a queue worker, an agent. Consent is then never started; a token that
    cannot be refreshed raises :class:`ConsentRequired` naming the cause and the
    fix. This is not an edge case: an OAuth client left in "Testing" rotates
    refresh tokens out after about seven days, so anything scheduled hits it
    weekly.

    Even with the default ``interactive=True`` the call can no longer hang:
    consent is bounded by ``timeout_seconds``
    (:data:`DEFAULT_CONSENT_TIMEOUT_S`), and a timeout is reported as the same
    :class:`ConsentRequired`, because "nobody answered" and "nobody could
    answer" want the same thing done about them.

    Consent always goes through a temporary local web server on ``port`` (``0``
    picks a free one), because Google retired the copy-paste "out-of-band" flow
    in 2022. ``open_browser=False`` only stops the browser from being launched:
    the authorization URL is printed instead, and the redirect must still reach
    that local server.

    Headless recipe: pass ``interactive=True`` (there is no terminal, so the
    default would refuse), ``open_browser=False`` and a fixed ``port=``, then
    forward that port from the machine holding the browser
    (``ssh -L <port>:localhost:<port> <host>``). Nothing needs registering in
    the Cloud console — the *Desktop app* client this module requires accepts
    any ``localhost`` port, which is also why the ``port=0`` default works.

    The call blocks until the redirect arrives, bounded by ``timeout_seconds``
    (default :data:`DEFAULT_CONSENT_TIMEOUT_S`; pass ``None`` for the library's
    "wait indefinitely", which is what this used to do).

    **No shared ``localhost``? Use** ``consent="paste"``. Consent then needs no
    running server and no waiting: the first call returns by raising
    :class:`~yb.youtube.paste_consent.ConsentPending` carrying the URL to open
    (anywhere — a phone will do); the browser's redirect to ``localhost`` fails
    to load, and the second call passes that address-bar URL (or just its
    ``code``) as ``authorization_response=`` to finish and cache the token. The
    two calls may be separate turns or separate processes; ``yb auth`` is the
    command-line form. ``port`` only names the (unreachable) redirect.

    These keywords ride ``**cred_kwargs`` through :func:`get_service` and the
    publishing helpers. The few entry points that take none (notably
    :func:`yb.music.publish.publish_folder`) still work headlessly: call this
    once to mint the token, after which nothing prompts again.
