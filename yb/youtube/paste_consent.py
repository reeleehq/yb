"""Paste-back OAuth consent: consent from a machine nobody is sitting at.

The normal flow (``InstalledAppFlow.run_local_server``) keeps a web server up on
``localhost`` and waits for Google to redirect the browser to it. That needs the
browser and the process to share a ``localhost`` — which a session driven from a
phone does not have: the consent page opens on the phone, the redirect goes to
the *phone's* ``localhost``, and the process (no terminal, nothing to wait on)
gives up with :class:`~yb.youtube.auth.ConsentRequired`.

Paste-back splits consent into two steps that need no shared network and no
live process in between, so they can happen in different turns, even in
different Python processes:

1. :func:`start_paste_consent` builds the authorization URL and saves the one
   thing the second step needs (the PKCE verifier and ``state``) to a short-lived
   file next to the token. The user opens the URL anywhere and consents.
2. Google redirects to ``http://localhost:<port>/?state=…&code=…``. That page
   will not load — expected. The user copies the address-bar URL (or just the
   ``code``) back, and :func:`finish_paste_consent` completes the exchange.

Most callers never import this module: ``get_credentials(consent="paste")`` and
the ``yb auth`` command drive it. Nothing here writes the token — the caller
(``get_credentials``) does, so there is one place that does.
